# Documentation Standards

- Write concise, skimmable Markdown.
- Prefer short sections, bullets, and clear headings.
- Include runnable commands in fenced code blocks.
- Keep docs aligned with the actual repository state (avoid speculation).
- Document the chosen approach instead of redesigning requirements.
- Cite sources when using external documentation.
